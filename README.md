# BlackJack
This is a basic black jack game that will allow game play for up to 4 players.
I hope to keep track of bets won and loss in a PostgrSQL database.
Eventually, I will write code so that the game can play itself according to basic strategy.
I hope to keep track of wins and losses based on the opening situation of each hand and build in functionality to adjust basic stratregy as you wish.
The probabilities associated with the game are interesting, and I hope to glean some good data from the autoplay mode.
